# Need-for-Shift
This is an app that encrypts strings using Ceasar's Cipher.
This is the link https://sammychinedu2ky.github.io/Need-for-Shift/index.html

## What is ceaser cipher
It's a crytographic method where words are moved a number of places backward as the occur in the alphabet.

### Example
Suppose we have a word, "tech".
If we are to encrypt it for 2 cycles, it would go this way

#### First Cycle
* t -> s
* e -> d
* c -> b
* h -> g
word is now sdbg

#### Second Cycle
* s -> r
* d -> c
* b -> a
* g -> f
word is now rcaf

So, after two cycles, tech becomes rcaf
